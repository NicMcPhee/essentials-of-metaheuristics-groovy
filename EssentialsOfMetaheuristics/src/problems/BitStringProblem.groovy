     * Having this take an option array of bits works, but probably isn't
     * super efficient, especially for large bit strings, as we need to allocate
     * memory for and construct the full set of bits, which is really not
     * necessary. An alternative would be to send in a closure that will return
     * a 0 or 1 every time it's called. The default closure could return random
     * bits, while for testing we could send in a closure that advances through
     * an fixed array of bits. For now, however, this works, so I'm going to leave
     * it alone and move on.
